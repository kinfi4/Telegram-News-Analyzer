# Propaganda Analyzer

This project was created by me in May 2022, three months have passed since Russia attacked Ukraine and started the most brutal, most terrible war since 1939.

This is the first war in the world that is taking place not only on earth, but also in the minds of millions and even billions of people.
The information war is very important, so I decided to create a special system that will analyze news from both Ukrainian and Russian sources (Telegram channels).

----------------------------------------

The system has two main purposes: classify news into four categories and give the sentiment coloring of the news

Four categorical classes are:   
        
* Shelling - everything that is connected with fighting and shelling.
* Economic - news about sanctions, economic situation and so on.
* Humanitarian - everything that is connected with a life of an ordinary people
* Political - sayings, comments and estimations of politicians

For classification, I created 6 models: **Decision Tree, Support Vector Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes, LSTM Neuron Network, 1D CNN Neuron Network, KNN.

Ok, now let's take a look at what do we have:
